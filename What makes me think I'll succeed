What makes me think I'll succeed as a coder.

I have to succeed, it probably sounds somehow but I need to. Even though I am still new to coding and I'm learning as I go, it makes me so excited. 
I am someone who gets so much pleasure from creating things and seeing things come to life. In as far as I know that's like the basis of being a coder. 
I'm a dedicated person and enjoy going an extra mile when I enjoy doing something, I think that is a good quality a coder can have.
