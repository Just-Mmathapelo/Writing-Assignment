# Writing-Assignment

My free time

My Mother runs a Day-Care Centre, in my free time I go help them out. My duties include helping the kids learn how to write, from the basics of learning how to hold a pencil, and that's what I enjoy the most.
I also do their
administration work. When I am home I love cooking and baking. I haven't been watching too much TV lately, I enjoy listening to podcasts and the radio. Going forward I'll be using my free time to practice what I have learned during the bootcamp and improve my skills.
