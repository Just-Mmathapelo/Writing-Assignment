My future: good parts

The life that I desire is one where I have a comfortable life, be able to afford basic needs such as a house of my own, a beautiful car and be able to travel. I
travel. I wish to go to a more technologically advanced country like India, Japan and * for three to five years in future to study and improve my skills. On
skills. On a personal aspect of things, I would like to just be a great help to my parents and show them how grateful I am to have them. Even them eventhem,
eventhem, even them. Even though it's every year's resolution, I wish to adopt a healthier lifestyle. The effect that it would have on my community and family. Coming from a place where success stories are very few, my success would be inspirational to my siblings and my community members.
I wish to prove that it is not possible for all of us to be Medical Doctors and Accountants, but we can still have a fulfilling life filled with so many opportunities.


Even though a career in tech is popular in some parts of the country, where I come from it sounds far-fetched because of the lack of gadgets such as computers. Most of us get to use a computer for the first time in tertiary institutions.
That is where I come in. I wish to close that gap, that would be my way of giving back to my community members. Having a center where community members can be able to learn at least the basics of a computer and how to navigate it would be beneficial. That way they will be able to do basic things such as to type a CV, to search for job opportunities and to apply to tertiary institutions.
It is very important that I succeed because I know that there is a whole clan of people that would benefit from that; it would also just be fulfilling and give me purpose in life.
