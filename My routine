I'm a night owl kind of a person. 
I am very productive at night when there isn't too much distraction, with that said if there is a deadline that I am trying to meet then anytime is tea time.
To be honest I haven't been taking track of how many hours a day did I spend working towards my projects since bootcamp but that's what me through the day.
I also do not want to limit myself by setting hours for each day, the aim is just to get as much work as I can.
